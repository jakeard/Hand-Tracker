# Hand Tracker

This is my **Hand Tracker** software. This program uses the camera connected to your device to track the position of your hand and fingers, and then uses that information to do an action, such as moving, clicking, and scrolling the mouse, or pressing keys.

I decided to tackle this project because I wanted to learn about and work with machine learning, as well as create a cool program that I can branch off of in many different ways. By spending the time to learn these topics and practice with them, I hope to gain a greater insight into the capabilities of coding and what I really can do with it.
